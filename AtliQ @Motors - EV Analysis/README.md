## Project Objective -

AtliQ Motors is an automotive giant from the USA specializing in electric vehicles
(EV). In the last 5 years, their market share rose to 25% in the electric and hybrid
vehicles segment in North America. As a part of their expansion plans, they wanted
to launch their bestselling models in India where their market share is less than 2%.
Bruce Haryali, the chief of AtliQ Motors India wanted to do a detailed market study
of the existing EV/Hybrid market in India before proceeding further.

As a Data Analyst, I analyzed the Indian EV market and provided insights to the company so they could take an informed decision.

## Recommendations

Here are some recommendations that I believe it may help the company to set up and grow its business in India

**1. Focus on High-Growth States with Strong EV Adoption**

Target states with high EV adoption rates and robust government incentives for EVs, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Gujarat. Focusing on regions with strong government support and consumer interest in EVs provides a solid foundation for market entry and growth. This approach also enhances brand visibility where demand is high.

**2. Invest in Affordable 2-wheelers with Enhanced Features**

The 2-wheeler segment is the most popular in India, especially among middle-income consumers. AtliQ Motors can capture a significant share of this segment and build brand loyalty by offering value-for-money products. The company should also invest in R&D to develop EVs tailored to Indian conditions, such as extreme temperatures and rough roads, for both 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers.

**3. Involvement in Sports**

Cricket is the most popular sport in India, and involvement in cricket can significantly boost brand visibility. Sponsorships and partnerships in cricket can help AtliQ Motors connect with a broad audience.

**4. Building an EV Ecosystem**

Like Tata Motors, AtliQ Motors should focus on building its own EV ecosystem to reduce reliance on other companies. This could involve setting up a network of charging stations, developing software solutions, and offering integrated services that enhance the overall customer experience.
